# GameList Website Project

## Project Description
The goal of this GameList project is to display my skills with various different technologies to create a cohesive product. This project is built using the **MERN** stack, and utilizes the [IGDB API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#getting-started) for pulling game data.

This app will allow users to search for games that they have played, and add them to their profiles, along with data such as a rating and time played.

This app is inspired by websites/services such as [Backloggd](https://backloggd.com/), [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/), and [AniList](https://anilist.co/).
